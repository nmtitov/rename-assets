Rename Assets
=======================

Description
-----------

There are six apps included. These apps are Automator apps with custom icon inside. If you make change to them via Automator, you have to update icon manually.

- @2x app adds "@2x" suffix to basename of any file
- @2x app adds "@3x" suffix to basename of any file
- -@2x app removes "@2x" suffix from basename of any file
- -@3x app removes "@3x" suffix from basename of any file
- @2x to @3x app replaces "@2x" suffix with "@3x" suffix in basename of any file
- @3x to @2x app replaces "@3x" suffix with "@2x" suffix in basename of any file

All apps work with one or multiple files.

Sometimes you need these operations to fix naming issues of automatically generated (or exported) images.

Usage
-----

Drag and drop Automator apps to dock. Then drag and drop files. Names of files will be modified in place.

Here's my Dock where I put these apps for quick access:

There are much smarter and sophisticated programs for bulk renaming, but I don't care :-)
